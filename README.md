# Independant Data Projects

### [Netflix Genre Labeler](https://github.com/Johndsalas/netflix_genre_labeler/tree/main) 
Leveraged data analysis and Natural Language Processing to investigate generating genre labels for Netflix films based on the Netflix descriptions of those films and developed a logistic regression machine learning model capable of predicting if a film was in the comedy genre with ~78% accuracy

### [Chess Upsets Example Project](https://github.com/Johndsalas/chess_upsets_example_project) 
Leveraged data analysis and classification machine learning tools to look for drivers of upsets in chess games. This Project is now linked in Codeup's curriculum and serves as an example to students beginning their first projects.

### [Earth’s Temperature Time Series](https://github.com/Johndsalas/earths_temperature_time_series) 
Leveraged time series machine learning techniques to develop Holt-Winter models capable of predicting the Earth’s average monthly temperature with less than one degree of error

### [Magic The Gathering Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Johndsalas/Sentiment_Analysis_Magic_The_Gathering)
Leveraged natural language processing, and regression machine learning techniques to look for drivers of sentiment in the flavor text of Magic: the Gathering Cards

# Capstones

### [Predicting Employee Attrition](https://github.com/Johndsalas/employee_churn)
**Capstone Project for DataRobot’s 10x: Applied Data Science Academy** <br>
Utilized a combination of Pandas and DataRobot’s model building UI to develop an ensemble model capable of predicting employee attrition 3.5x better than chance. The estimated ROI when predicting the top 20% of employees likely to attrit was $650K per year. 

### [Early Failing Hard Drive Analysis](https://github.com/just-keep-spinning/hard-drive-project)
**Capstone Project for Codeup** <br>
Leveraged Spark, Pandas, and classification machine learning techniques to develop a support vector machine capable of predicting 93% of early failing hard drives

# Non-Data Projects Just for Fun

### [Pony Racing Game](https://github.com/Johndsalas/racing_simulator)
Leveraged pygame and python classes to develop a game where players watch ponies race across a field 

### [Space Game](https://github.com/Johndsalas/space_game)
Leveraged pygame to develop a fully interactable “space invaders” inspired game 

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/Johndsalas/Sudoku_Solver)
Leveraged recursion to develop an algorithm capable of solving any Sudoku board 

### [Space Commander](https://github.com/Johndsalas/space_commander)
Leveraged random to create a python text-based game where player make strategic decisions about how to manage limited resources
