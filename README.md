# Independant Data Projects

### [Chess Upsets Example Project](https://github.com/Johndsalas/chess_upsets_example_project) 
Leveraged data classification machine learning tools to look for drivers of churn in chess games. This Project is now linked in the Codeup curriculum and serves as an example to students beginning their first projects

### [Earth’s Temperature Time Series](https://github.com/Johndsalas/earths_temperature_time_series) 
Leveraged time series machine learning techniques to develop Holt-Winter models capable of predicting the Earth’s average monthly temperature with less than one degree of error

### [Magic: the Gathering Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Johndsalas/Sentiment_Analysis_Magic_The_Gathering)
Leveraged natural language processing, and regression machine learning techniques to look for drivers of churn in the flavor text of Magic: the Gathering Cards

# Coursework Data Projects

## Capstones:

### [Predicting Employee Attrition](https://github.com/Johndsalas/employee_churn)
**Capstone Project for DataRobot’s 10x: Applied Data Science Academy** <br>
Utilized a combination of Pandas and DataRobot’s model building UI to develop an ensemble model capable of predicting employee attrition 3.5x better than chance. The estimated ROI when predicting the top 20% of employees likely to attrit was $650K per year. 

### [Early Failing Hard Drive Analysis](https://github.com/just-keep-spinning/hard-drive-project)
**Capstone Project for Codeup** <br>
Leveraged Spark, Pandas, and classification machine learning techniques to develop a support vector machine capable of predicting 93% of early failing hard drives

## Other Codeup Projects

### [GitHub NLP Analysis](https://github.com/JSBayes/NLP-Project)
Leveraged web scraping, natural language processing, and classification machine learning techniques to develop a random forest with AdaBoost classifier capable of predicting the programming language of a GitHub repository from the contents of its readme file 30% better than chance

### [Zillow Log-Error](https://github.com/P-F-M/logerror_zillow)
Leveraged clustering and regression machine learning techniques to look for drivers of Error in Zillow’s property value predictions

### [Zillow Property Value](https://github.com/Johndsalas/zillow_project)
Leveraged data analytics and regression machine learning techniques to look for drivers of property value in Zillow properties

# Non-Data Projects Just for  Fun!:

### [Pony Racing Game](https://github.com/Johndsalas/racing_simulator)
Leveraged pygame and python classes to develop a game where players watch ponies race across a field 

### [Space Game](https://github.com/Johndsalas/space_game)
Leveraged pygame to develop a fully interactable “space invaders” inspired game 

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/Johndsalas/Sudoku_Solver)
Leveraged recursion to develop an algorithm capable of solving any Sudoku board 

### [Space Commander](https://github.com/Johndsalas/space_commander)
Leveraged random to create a python text-based game where player make strategic decisions about how to manage limited resources
